<h1 align=center> Auxiliary Functions for the k-Wave Toolbox </h1>

<p align=justify>
This repository contains auxiliary functions for the <a href="http://www.k-wave.org/">k-Wave Toolbox</a>. The functions available in this repo are as follows:

<ul>
<li><a href="./place_source_grid.m">place_source_grid.m</a>: Places an ultrasound transducer in emitter mode in a given simulation grid;</li>

<li><a href="./kwave_plots.m">kwave_plots.m</a>: Enables the plotting of the performed acoustic simulations in .GIF mode, over-time, and in .PNG mode when computing the RMS value of the acoustic pressure over the simulation period;</li>

<li><a href="./turnbull_delays.m">turnbull_delays.m</a>: A function for the creation of the phase delay matrix for emitter mode simulations of the piezoelectric transducer;</li>

</p>

These auxiliary functions were developed at the Microelectronics Group, Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science (EEMCS) Faculty of the Delft University of Technology (TU Delft), Delft, The Netherlands.
